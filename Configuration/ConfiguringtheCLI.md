# Configuring the CLI
When it comes to configuration, most of the time you'll be focused on managing the runtime settings for a particular app: the port, database connections, and so forth.  But in Sails, there are also a handful of powerful options available for configuring the global Sails CLI itself.

The `.sailsrc` file is unique from other configuration sources in Sails in that it may also be used to configure the global Sails (i.e. command-line tool).  The main reason to configure the command-line is to customize the [generators]() that are used when `sails generate` and `sails new` are run.
