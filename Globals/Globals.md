# Globals
### Overview

For convenience, Sails exposes a handful of global variables.  By default, your app's [models](), [services](), and the global `sails` object are all available on the global scope; meaning you can refer to them by name anywhere in your backend code (as long as Sails [has been lifted](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/tree/master/lib/app)).

Nothing in Sails core relies on these global variables - each and every global exposed in Sails may be disabled in `sails.config.globals` (conventionally configured in `config/globals.js`.)


### The `sails` Object
Most of this section of the docs focuses on the methods and properties of `sails`, the singleton object representing your app.  In most cases, you will want to keep the `sails` object globally accessible- it makes your app code much cleaner.  However, if you _do_ need to disable _all_ globals, including `sails`, you can get access to `sails` on the request object (`req`).

### Models and Services
Your app's [models]() and [services]() are exposed as global variables using their `globalId`.  For instance, the model defined in the file `api/models/Foo.js` will be globally accessible as `Foo`, and the service defined in `api/services/Baz.js` will be available as `Baz`.

### Async and Lodash
Sails also exposes an instance of [lodash]() as `_`, and an instance of [async]() as `async`.  These commonly-used utilities are provided by default so that you don't have to `npm install` them in every new project.  Like any of the other globals in sails, they can be disabled.


> Bear in mind that none of the globals, including `sails`, are accessible until _after_ sails has lifted.  In other words, you won't be able to use `sails.models.user` or `User` outside of a function (since `sails` will not have finished loading yet.)
