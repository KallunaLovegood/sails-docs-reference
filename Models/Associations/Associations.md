# Model Associations
### Overview

With Sails and Waterline you can associate models across all data stores. This means that
your users can live in PostgreSQL and their photos can live in MongoDB and you can interact with
the data as if they lived together on the same database. You can also have associations that
live on seperate connections or in different databases within the same adapter.
